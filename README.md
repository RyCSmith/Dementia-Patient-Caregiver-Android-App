Dementia-Patient-Caregiver App

Overview: Android Phone/Tablet application providing flash-card style stimulus creation and practice as well as metric gathering for patients with dementia.

Design: This project was completed by Ryan Smith, Kelley Loder, Josh Kessler, Joo Kim and Krishna Chaitanya. It was submitted as a group project for CIS-573, Software Engineering at the University of Pennsylvania.

Use: This program launches as a normal Andorid application. 
-On login, user can Start Application (begin playing game with stimuli that have been previously recorded) or press and hold the bottom right hand corner of the screen to open the admin screen.
-The admin screen will allow a user to create stimuli for review. These include taking photos/using those on device, text for a question and recording voice prompts for questions, answers, positive feedback, negative feedback, etc. 
-The first time the admin screen is accessed after install, the admin will be prompted to create default postive and negative feedback messages and these will be optional when adding stimuli later.
-Also from the admin screen, metrics can be accessed that show how often the game was played, how many times each question was attempted and how frequently it was answered correctly. 
-When playing the game, the user is presented with a clean user interface which displays all information pertaining to a stimuli.
-A user provides a verbal answer and voice recognition is used to compare the accuracy of that answer to the correct one and provides appropriate feedback.
